    # If you remove this, all repositories will work in YOLO mode, meaning
    # nothing will ever be validated not even value types, you may then use
    # this API for arbitrary value storage.
    #
    # In the opposite, by defining a schema, you enable type and allowed
    # values validation for what is going to be stored, and also enable
    # the PreferenceSchema component in your container, allowing you to
    # dynamically build forms.
